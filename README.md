System for finding optimal path on urban road network of Novi Sad is implemented on Zynq-7000 SoC.
Starting from an executable specification written in C++, the performance bottleneck of a system model based on Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm is refined down to the RTL level of abstraction.
A virtual platform was used to support parallel development and testing of both hardware and software components.
